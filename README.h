 * SVG is a W3C standard, you can find it at
 * http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/ .  MadButterfly implements SVG Tiny 1.2,

 * format with XML techinology.  Major browsers, except IE, support to view
 * SVG files.  SVG graphics can also be embedded in HTML pages.  Another
 * project, MadSwatter; brother of MadButterfly, is running on Firefox
 * as a platform and using SVG techinology to construct it's functions.
 * (see, http://www.assembla.com/spaces/MadSwatter )
