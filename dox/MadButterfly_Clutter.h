/*! \page mb_clutter What is MadButterfly different from Clutter.
 *
 * Maybe some people would ask, "why don't you just use Clutter?"
 * The anwser is the author of MadButterfly know name of Clutter,
 * but he don't know what is Clutter exactly when he start the project.
 * The author of MadButterfly is some kind of cowboy, he make things
 * just because he have some ideas.  Actually, he know what Clutter
 * just one week after starting the project.  Some guy send him a
 * video from Andre Schmidt.  Andre implements a software to control
 * volumne of sound card as a concept proving for idea of using
 * SVG as a media to connect UI designers and application programmers.
 * The work of Andre is based on Clutter.  It is first time the author
 * of MadButterfly know what Clutter is exactly.
 *
 * Although, they are so similar.  We can also find some thing different.
 * Clutter is heavily depend on OpenGL/OpenGL ES.  Most embedded systems
 * do not have OpenGL included.  MadButterfly have a static/compile time
 * SVG to C translator.  MadButterfly is focus on implementing mechanism
 * to adapt SVG to C and other languages.  Clutter is about more and more
 * heavy.
